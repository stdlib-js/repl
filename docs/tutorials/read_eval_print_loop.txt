| \*Tutorial: REPL\s


How to use this tutorial...

• Enter

  ```javascript
  next();
  ```

  followed by \*RETURN\s to advance the tutorial.

---

• At the command prompt, enter

  ```javascript
  pres();
  ```

  followed by \*RETURN\s to see the list of available tutorial commands.

---

• As documented when running \*pres()\s, you can use command shortcuts.
  For example, enter

  ```javascript
  n();
  ```

  followed by \*RETURN\s to advance the tutorial.

---

• Use the up/down arrow keys to cycle through previously run commands.
  Feel free to try using the arrow keys below...

---

• When entering and running commands, the tutorial presentation slide is
  likely to scroll out of view.

  To return to the slide, simply scroll up. :grinning:

---

• As this tutorial is a REPL presentation, enter

  ```javascript
  presentationStop();
  ```

  followed by \*RETURN\s to end this tutorial at any time.

• Enter

  ```javascript
  quit();
  ```

  to exit the REPL altogether.

---

| Enough preliminaries, let's start the tutorial!

---

| This tutorial introduces you to the REPL environment.

---

| REPL stands for \*r\sead-\*e\sval-\*p\srint \*l\soop\s.

---

| A REPL...

\s

--

• ...is an interactive programming environment

--

• ...which receives individual user inputs (e.g., single expressions)

--

• ...evaluates those inputs

--

• ...and returns the result.

---


| Accordingly, an entered program is executed piecewise and sequentially.

---

In this tutorial, you've already been using the REPL when you've advanced
the tutorial and printed the list of available commands.

As another simple example, evaluate the following input

```javascript
1+1
```

--

\s
In this case, we entered `1+1` (user inputs) and instructed the REPL to evaluate
those inputs (\*RETURN\s), and the REPL returned (and printed) the result.

--

\s
After returning the result, the REPL provides another prompt, thus completing
the \*r\sead-\*e\sval-\*p\srint \*l\soop.

---

| REPLs are useful for...
\s

--

• learning programming languages (such as JavaScript)

--

• debugging (including when embedded in running applications)

--

• demos (including live coding)

--

• interactivity (such as during iterative development)

---

To get started using this REPL, a few commands will prove immensely useful.

---

The first command is

```javascript
help()
```

Run the above command to see a list of REPL commands.

---

To see the documentation for a specific REPL alias, provide the alias to the
\*help()\s command.

For example, run

```javascript
help( '{{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}}' )
```

to see the documentation for the \*{{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}}\s function.

---

On the previous slide, you specified the alias via a string representing the
alias name.

You can also provide a reference pointing to the aliased value.

For example, run

```javascript
help( {{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}} )
```

to see the same documentation as before.

---

Additionally, for objects having known methods, you can print method
documentation.

For example, run

```javascript
help( {{alias:@stdlib/random/base/randu}}.factory )
```

to see the \*factory()\s method documentation.

---

Lastly, for select objects having a known constructor, you can provide
instances.

For example, create a \*Float64Array\s

```javascript
var x = new {{alias:@stdlib/array/float64}}( 10 );
```

and then run

```javascript
help( x )
```

which will print the documentation for \*Float64Array\s.

---

The \*help()\s command provides detailed API documentation.

Sometimes, you just want to know the function signature and a brief
description.

For this use case, you can use another command: \*info()\s.

For example, run

```javascript
info( '{{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}}' )
```

to see abbreviated API documentation for \*{{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}}\s.

---

Similar to \*help()\s, you can provide a variable reference.

For example, run

```javascript
info( {{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}} )
```

to see the same abbreviated API documentation.

---

Another useful command is \*example()\s, which runs the example code found in
the documentation printed by \*help()\s.

For example, run

```javascript
example( '{{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}}' )
```

to run the example code found in the documentation for \*{{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}}\s.

---

Similarly to \*help()\s and \*info()\s, you can provide a variable reference.

For example, run

```javascript
example( {{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}} )
```

to again run the example code for \*{{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}}\s.

---

Finally, two other commands are useful when wanting to resolve aliases and
package implementations.

---

To determine which package corresponds to a specified alias, use
\*alias2pkg()\s.

For example, run

```javascript
alias2pkg( '{{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}}' )
```

or

```javascript
alias2pkg( {{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}} )
```

to resolve the package for \*{{alias:@stdlib/math/base/special/sin}}\s.

---

To determine which alias corresponds to a specified package, use
\*pkg2alias()\s.

For example, run

```javascript
pkg2alias( '@stdlib/math/base/special/sin' )
```

to resolve the alias for \*@stdlib/math/base/special/sin\s.

---

When you're working in a REPL, you're often interested in viewing the
results of the previously invoked command.

Accordingly, when you run

```javascript
1+1
```

you should see the result \*2\s.

---

However, at other times you'll want to silence printed output.

To do so, add a \*semicolon\s to any statement.

For example, when you add a semicolon to the previous statement

```javascript
1+1;
```

no result is printed.

---

During iterative development, you'll occasionally forget to assign the
results of the last expression or statement.

Fortunately, the REPL has a special variable which stores the last result:
\*ans\s.

For example, run the previous statement

```javascript
1+1;
```

followed by

```javascript
ans
```

to see that \*ans\s is assigned the value \*2\s.

---

While not encouraged for general use, \*ans\s can be used just like any
other variable within the top-level scope.

---

Another common occurrence during iterative development within a REPL
environment is forgetting variable names or failing to remember what
variables have already been declared.

Thankfully, you can run

```javascript
vars()
```

to return a list of user-defined variable names. For additional variable
details, run

```javascript
help( vars )
```

to see function options.

---

To facilitate working with long variable names and nested property access,
the REPL supports \*TAB\s completion.

For example, enter

```javascript
base.r
```

followed by \*TAB\s to generate a list of auto-completions which begin
with the letter \*r\s.

---

Similarly, if you create a nested object

```javascript
var obj = { 'beep': { 'boop': { 'foo': 'bar' } } };
```

and then enter

```javascript
obj.beep.b
```

followed by \*TAB\s, the nested property \*boop\s should auto-complete.

---

\*TAB\s completion also works with computed properties. For example, enter

```javascript
obj[ 'beep' ][ 'b
```

followed by \*TAB\s to auto-complete the nested property \*boop\s as done
in the previous slide.

---

For select APIs interacting with the filesystem, \*TAB\s completion is
supported for file paths.

For example, enter

```javascript
{{alias:@stdlib/fs/read-file}}.sync( './
```

followed by \*TAB\s to generate a list of applicable file paths.

---

Additionally, \*TAB\s completion is supported for variables defined in a
nested scope.

For example, enter

```javascript
function foo() { var beep = 5; be
```

followed by \*TAB\s to auto-complete the variable \*beep\s.

Similarly, entering

```javascript
function foo( beep ) { console.log( be
```

followed by \*TAB\s auto-completes the parameter \*beep\s.

---

When working in a REPL, you'll often times want to explore and test
functions and workflows using different parameterizations and variable
values.

Managing the various variables can be messy and difficult.

To this end, this REPL introduces the concept of workspaces.

---

A \*workspace\s is simply a named collection of user-defined variables.

---

To print the name of the current workspace, run

```javascript
currentWorkspace
```

Take note of this workspace name.

---

To retrieve a list of all workspaces, run

```javascript
workspaces()
```

---

To either switch to or create a workspace, you can use the \*workspace()\s
command. For example, enter

```javascript
workspace( '
```

followed by \*TAB\s to see a list of existing workspaces to which you can
switch.

---

To switch to the "base" workspace, run

```javascript
workspace( 'base' )
```

If you now run

```javascript
vars()
```

notice that the variables defined in the previous workspace are no longer
present.

Return back to the tutorial workspace.

---

Run the \*help()\s command to see additional workspace-related commands.

---

JavaScript is single-threaded and asynchronous.

To support asynchronous APIs, the REPL supports top-level \*async\s/\*await\s.

---

In Node.js environments supporting \*async\s/\*await\s, run

```javascript
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve( 'beep' ), 2000))
```

which will return the resolved value.

---

In older Node.js environments and when using non-promise APIs, you can
invoke a \*__done__\s callback.

For example, define the following function

```javascript
function foo() {setTimeout(() => __done__(null, 'beep'), 2000)};
```

To asynchronously resolve the value, run

```javascript
"async"; foo()
```

where the special directive \*"async";\s indicates that a command is
asynchronous.

---

During iterative development, you'll frequently want to rerun one or more
commands.

For example, let's say you want to simulate the rolling of two fair dice

```javascript
var dice = {{alias:@stdlib/random/base/discrete-uniform}}.factory( 1, 6, {'seed': 1234} );
function roll() { return [ dice(), dice() ]; };
```

To roll the dice, enter the following command one or more times

```javascript
roll()
```

---

To regenerate the same dice roll sequence, run

```javascript
rerun( [ X, Y ] )
```

where \*X\s is the line number where you declared \*dice\s and \*Y\s is
a line number where you invoked \*roll()\s.

\*rerun\s is especially useful for saving keystrokes when rerunning
arbitrary sequences of commands.

---

When working in a REPL, you'll have use cases where you'll want to
encapsulate extended logic in external files.

These files will typically export functionality and/or data which you
can then import into the REPL environment.

For example, open up your favorite editor, create a new file, and paste
the following code

```javascript
function beep() {
    return 'boop';
}

module.exports = beep;
```

---

To load your newly created file, enter

```javascript
var beep = require( './
```

followed by \*TAB\s to use \*TAB\s completion to locate your file.

Once you've resolved the file's path and executed the command, run

```javascript
beep()
```

which should return the value \*'boop'\s.

---

Now modify your file to match the following contents

```javascript
function beep() {
    return 'beepboop';
}

module.exports = beep;
```

Rerun the \*require()\s statement you entered above and run

```javascript
beep()
```

Did the command return \*'beepboop'\s?

---

\*require()\s works by caching the exports of previously required modules.

To explicitly reload your modified file, enter

```javascript
beep = rerequire( './
```

followed by \*TAB\s to use \*TAB\s completion to once again locate your file.

Once you've resolved the file's path and executed the command, run

```javascript
beep()
```

which should return the expected value.

---

For those use cases where you need to reload a module and all of its module
dependencies, use \*deeprerequire()\s.

---

Working in a REPL frequently involves working with data.

To facilitate exploring that data, the REPL provides a plot API.

---

As a simple example, define two 1-dimensional data arrays corresponding
to the x- and y-axis plot data, respectively.

```javascript
var x = {{alias:@stdlib/utils/inmap}}( new {{alias:@stdlib/array/int32}}(100), (v,i) => i );
var y = [ ...{{alias:@stdlib/random/iter/randu}}({'iter':x.length}) ];
```

---

Next, define a new \*Plot\s instance by running

```javascript
var plt = new {{alias:@stdlib/plot/ctor}}( [x], [y] );
```

To view the plot in a separate window, run

```javascript
plt.view( 'window' )
```

---

To further explore the \*Plot\s API, run

```javascript
help( {{alias:@stdlib/plot/ctor}} )
```

---

Hopefully, by now, you've realized how powerful (and fun!) programming in
a REPL can be! :grinning:
